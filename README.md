# Hindi-Deepfake-Dataset
Hindi audio-video-Deepfake (HAV-DF)

The Hindi Audio-Video Deepfake (HAV-DF) Dataset is the first large-scale, Hindi-language deepfake dataset designed to address the challenges of deepfake detection in low-resource languages. This dataset offers a diverse collection high-quality videos, including both real and synthetically manipulated content. It is specifically curated to aid in developing robust deepfake detection systems that account for linguistic and cultural nuances of Hindi-speaking communities.

# Key Features

**1. Multimodal Content:** Combines both audio and video manipulations, making it ideal for testing multimodal deepfake detection algorithms.

**2. Manipulation Techniqu**es: Includes face-swapping, lip-syncing, and voice cloning, providing a comprehensive range of deepfake types.

**3. Balanced Representation:** Features diverse subjects, ensuring balanced representation across age, gender, and ethnicity.

# Data Composition

**Real Videos:** 200 authentic videos sourced from YouTube.
**Deepfake Videos:** 308 synthetically manipulated videos
